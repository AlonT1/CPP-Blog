     *******************************************************************************************
     noexcept is an optimizations which means â€œif this throws, terminate the program by calling std::terminate .
     This is useful because the possibility of exceptions has some overhead.
     But the cost of crashing migh be too high.
     If your not shure if this function will throw in the future I would not use noexcept on it.
     As Jason Turner puts it. You should not sprinkel it around like const.
     *******************************************************************************************
     According to the C++ Standard, dtors are implicitly marked noexcept(true).
     This behavior was introduced with C++11 to make destructors safer and to encourage more predictable exception handling.
     Note that noexcept == noexcept(true)
     noexcept(false) - the function may throw exceptions - this is the default for functions

    //in older cpp, the copy ctor was moved to private, this solution isn't
    //sufficient since the copy ctor can still be invoked in-class
